# BaltimoreWeatherPatterns

Baltimore has a long history of damaging weather patterns that devastate its lands and agricultural industries. A small team of us decided to look into this and test whether Data Science principles and Machine Learning algorithm could be used to predict Baltimore's weather patterns over the course of a full year. We planned on doing this by testing various Machine Learning Algorithms and using the 5 stages of analyzing data, including data pre-processing, data cleaning, data filtration, data transformation, and data reduction.
